# 🛡️ TOTAL PROTOCOL: Institutional Litepaper v1.1

## 📍 1. Executive Summary
Total Protocol is an omnichain settlement layer designed to unlock $1.5T in Bitcoin liquidity. We replace custodial bridges with a trustless, modular architecture powered by ZK-Proofs, BitVM, and EigenLayer AVS.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Core Architecture

### Nexus Layer (Verification)
The universal verification hub using ZK-Light Clients for instant, trustless state transitions.

### BitVM & Bitcoin Settlement
We bring Ethereum-style programmability to Bitcoin via BitVM. 
* **1-of-N Trust Model:** Security is guaranteed as long as one challenger is honest.
* **Native Assets:** No wrapped tokens; we settle on Bitcoin L1.

### Gas Abstraction
Users pay transaction fees in the asset they are swapping (BTC, ETH, USDC) or in $TOTAL. No native gas hurdles.

---

## 🔐 3. Security & Invariants
The protocol is governed by five immutable mathematical laws:
1. **Solvency:** Σ(Wrapped) == Σ(Locked Native).
2. **Integrity:** BTC withdrawal requires a verified ZK-Proof.
3. **Liveness:** AVS nodes have guaranteed challenge windows.
4. **Timelock:** 48-hour programmatic delay for all admin actions.
5. **Economic Finality:** Capped by slashable AVS stake.

## 📊 6. Competitive Landscape
* **vs LayerZero:** We use ZK-Math instead of Oracles.
* **vs Axelar:** We support Native BTC (BitVM), they use Wrapped assets.
* **Finality:** Instant (AVS Layer) vs High Latency.
