# $TOTAL Tokenomics: The Entropy-Backed Economy

The $TOTAL token is the native utility and security anchor of the TOTAL Protocol. In version 8.1 "Absolute Zero", the economy is directly tied to the laws of physics and hardware invariants.

## 📊 Token Overview
* **Ticker:** $TOTAL
* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (Fixed, non-inflationary)
* **Core Principle:** Hardware-Enforced Scarcity.

## 🛠 Token Utility (v.8.1 Enhancements)
1. **Entropy Staking:** To operate a **Sentinel Core** node, users must stake $TOTAL. Reward multipliers are applied based on the quality of the hardware QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) stream.
2. **Panic Deflation:** In the event of a "Panic Switch" activation at the protocol level, 0.5% of the total ecosystem reserve is burned to compensate for network-wide security recalibration.
3. **Hardware Gas:** Fees for nanosecond finality are paid in $TOTAL, calculated by the ZK-complexity processed by the FPGA.
4. **Governance:** Holders vote on "Physical Constants" of the network: Thermal Guard thresholds and Ghost Logic mutation cycles.

## 💰 Distribution & Vesting (The Iron Standard)
| Allocation | % | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sentinel Mining** | 40% | Rewards for hardware operators (10-year emission). |
| **Institutional Partners**| 15% | Strategic growth (Coinbase/a16z). 2-year lock. |
| **Development & R&D** | 20% | ASIC migration and Post-Quantum Research. |
| **International Group** | 15% | Founders & Core Devs (3-year lock). |
| **Initial Liquidity** | 10% | TGE on Tier-1 Exchanges. |

## 🛡️ Economic Security Invariants
* **Anti-Slashing:** Malicious nodes have their hardware fingerprint blacklisted at the protocol level, and their stake is permanently burned.
* **Buy-back & Burn:** 25% of all protocol revenue is used to buy back $TOTAL from the market to maintain the "Absolute Zero" deflationary curve.
