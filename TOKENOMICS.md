# $TOTAL Tokenomics: The Economic Security Layer

The $TOTAL token is the native utility and governance asset of the TOTAL Protocol, designed to align the interests of hardware validators, developers, and institutional users.

## 📊 Token Overview
* **Ticker:** $TOTAL
* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (Fixed)
* **Standard:** ERC-20 (on Ethereum/Sepolia for Phase 1)

## 🛠 Token Utility
1. **Hardware Staking:** Validators must stake $TOTAL to activate a **Sentinel Core** node. Malicious activity results in a hardware-level "slashing" of the stake.
2. **Protocol Fees:** All high-speed transactions verified by the Sentinel Core require gas fees paid in $TOTAL.
3. **Deflationary Burn:** 20% of all transaction fees are permanently burned, reducing the total supply over time.
4. **Governance:** Holders vote on hardware parameters, such as Oracle Shield thresholds and Ghost Logic mutation frequencies.
