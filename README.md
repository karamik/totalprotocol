## 🚀 Overview
**TOTAL Protocol** is a hybrid Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure designed to eliminate the "Security-Speed Paradox." By offloading critical consensus logic and cryptographic verification to dedicated hardware gates (FPGA), we bridge the gap between high-speed execution and absolute physical sovereignty.

### 🏛 The Hybrid Architecture:
* **📡 Sentinel Core (FPGA Layer):** The hardware heart. Executes protocol logic at nanosecond speeds.
* **📜 Sentinel Lite (Execution Layer):** Full EVM compatibility. Software-side agility.
